# ElementaryRubyTemperatureConverter information
An Elementary Temperature Converter between Celsius and Fahrenheit in one main file.  
The user can choose a temperature type and then a temperature, which the converter will convert and then print to the screen.  
If the user enters an invalid temperature type the program will recursively prompt the user to enter a valid temperature type.

#To run the file
The user needs to have a ruby interpreter installed, but the command to run the file is as follows:
ruby ./tempConvert.rb

#Inputting data
Upon inputting a char for a temperature type the program will automatically move on, but for the number the user will have
to press ENTER to invoke the temperature conversion.

#License remarks
This project was intended to help me get my feet wet with the Ruby coding language.  If it can help you learn, feel free
to copy snippets from it, but copy paste it to your portfolio at your own risk (not recommended).

#Style remarks
Yes, I am primarily a JavaScript programmer getting my feet wet with Ruby.  And accordingly, this code looks a bit strange 
stylistically.
